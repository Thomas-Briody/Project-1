# Project-1 - Space Invaders <img src='https://i.imgur.com/qk6fbSh.png' width="60"/>

**Overview**

The Brief for this project was to create a grid-based game utilising vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS within the 1 week timescale. Working individually, I chose Space Invaders from a predetermined list of grid-based games. Throughout this project, my knowledge and understanding of javascript was solidified, and I am happy with the final game that I was able to create.
